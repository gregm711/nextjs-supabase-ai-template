# Cursor Rules

These rules help an AI-based editor understand and navigate our codebase for the Next.js and Supabase Starter Kit. They outline our projectâ€™s architecture, coding conventions, and best practices.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Authentication & Database:** Supabase
- **Deployment:** Vercel (for the frontend)

---

## Project Structure

### Frontend

- **`app/`**  
  Contains the Next.js application using the App Router.

- **`components/`**  
  Shared and reusable React components.

- **`lib/`**  
  Utility functions, helper modules, and custom hooks.

- **`types/`**  
  TypeScript type definitions.

- **`public/`**  
  Static assets such as images and fonts.

- **`styles/`**  
  Global styles and Tailwind CSS configuration.

### Configuration Files

- **`.env.example`**  
  Lists all required environment variables.

- **`.env.local`**  
  Local environment variables (ensure sensitive data is not committed).

## Coding & Project Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for file and folder names.
- Use the `@` alias for root-level imports (e.g., `@/components`, `@/lib`).

### Component Development

- **Server Components:**  
  Fetch data on the server and pass it as props.

- **Client Components:**  
  Mark with `"use client"` for interactive features.

- **Organization:**
  - Route-specific components belong in `app/_components/`.
  - Shared components belong in the `components/` directory.

### Styling & UI

- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Leverage **shadcn/ui** for consistent UI components.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons when needed.

### Data & API Integration

- **Supabase:**
  - Handles both authentication and database interactions.
  - Use environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) to configure your connection.
  - Ensure all data interactions are secure and validated.

## AI Cursor Rules Specifics

- **Context Awareness:**  
  The codebase does not include a FastAPI backend. All backend functionality is managed through Supabase.

- **Focus Areas:**

  - When resolving queries, prioritize Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase integrations.
  - For UI/UX concerns, follow Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui guidelines.

- **Documentation & Navigation:**

  - Maintain up-to-date documentation in line with these rules.
  - The AI editor should use these guidelines to suggest code improvements, refactorings, or resolve questions based on the current tech stack.

- **Code Quality:**
  - Ensure code remains modular, testable, and well-documented.
  - Use clear and descriptive commit messages for version control.

## Final Note

These cursor rules serve as a living document. As our project evolves, update these rules to reflect new practices, technologies, or structural changes in our codebase.
